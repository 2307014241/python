The DNA sequence is composed of a series of nucleotides abbreviated as 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'.
For example, "ACGAATTCCG" is a DNA sequence.
When studying DNA, it is useful to identify repeated sequences within the DNA.
Given a string s that represents a DNA sequence, return all the 10-letter-long sequences (substrings) that occur more than once in a DNA molecule. You may return the answer in any order.

Example 1:
Input: s = "AAAAACCCCCAAAAACCCCCCAAAAAGGGTTT"
Output: ["AAAAACCCCC","CCCCCAAAAA"]
Example 2:
Input: s = "AAAAAAAAAAAAA"
Output: ["AAAAAAAAAA"]
 



For example:
Input	Result
AAAAACCCCCAAAAACCCCCCAAAAAGGGTTT	AAAAACCCCC
CCCCCAAAAA

s = input()
j = []
repeated = set()
for i in range(len(s) - 9):
    sequence = s[i:i+10]
    if sequence in j:
        repeated.add(sequence)
    else:
        j.append(sequence)
l=list(repeated)
l=list(reversed(l))
for i in l:
    print(i)
