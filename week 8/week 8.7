def findWords(words):
    row1 = set('qwertyuiop')
    row2 = set('asdfghjkl')
    row3 = set('zxcvbnm')
    
    result = []
    for word in words:
        w = set(word.lower())
        if w.issubset(row1) or w.issubset(row2) or w.issubset(row3):
            result.append(word)
    if len(result) == 0:
        print("No words")
    else:
        for i in result:
            print(i)    

a = int(input())
arr = [input() for i in range(a)]
findWords(arr)
