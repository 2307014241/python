There is a malfunctioning keyboard where some letter keys do not work. All other keys on the keyboard work properly.
Given a string text of words separated by a single space (no leading or trailing spaces) and a string brokenLetters of all distinct letter keys that are broken, return the number of words in text you can fully type using this keyboard.
Example 1:
Input: text = "hello world", brokenLetters = "ad"
Output: 
1
Explanation: We cannot type "world" because the 'd' key is broken.

For example:
Input	           Result
hello world      1
ad	

a=input()
b=input()
c=set()
for i in a:
    for j in b:
        if j in i:
            c.add(i)
print(len(c))
