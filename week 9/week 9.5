In the game of Scrabble™, each letter has points associated with it. The total score of a word is the sum of the scores of its letters. More common letters are worth fewer points while less common letters are worth more points. 
Write a program that computes and displays the Scrabble™ score for a word. Create a dictionary that maps from letters to point values. Then use the dictionary to compute the score.
A Scrabble™ board includes some squares that multiply the value of a letter or the value of an entire word. We will ignore these squares in this exercise.

The points associated with each letter are shown below:
Points Letters
1 A, E, I, L, N, O, R, S, T and U
2 D and G
3 B, C, M and P
4 F, H, V, W and Y
5 K
8 J and X
10 Q and Z

Sample Input
REC
Sample Output
REC is worth 5 points.

letter_scores = {
    'A': 1, 'E': 1, 'I': 1, 'L': 1, 'N': 1, 'O': 1, 'R': 1, 'S': 1, 'T': 1, 'U': 1,
    'D': 2, 'G': 2,
    'B': 3, 'C': 3, 'M': 3, 'P': 3,
    'F': 4, 'H': 4, 'V': 4, 'W': 4, 'Y': 4,
    'K': 5,
    'J': 8, 'X': 8,
    'Q': 10, 'Z': 10
}
word = input().upper()
score = sum(letter_scores.get(letter, 0) for letter in word)
print(word,"is worth",score,"points.")
