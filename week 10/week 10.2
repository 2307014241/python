Given an listof integers, sort the array in ascending order using the Bubble Sort algorithm above. Once sorted, print the following three lines:
1.      List is sorted in numSwaps swaps., where numSwaps is the number of swaps that took place.
2.      First Element: firstElement, the  first element in the sorted list.
3.      Last Element: lastElement, the last element in the sorted list.
For example, given a worst-case but small array to sort: a=[6,4,1]. It took  3 swaps to sort the array. Output would be
Array is sorted in 3 swaps.  
First Element: 1  
Last Element: 6   

Input Format
The first line contains an integer,n , the size of the list a .
The second line contains  n,  space-separated integers a[i].
Constraints
·         2<=n<=600
·         1<=a[i]<=2x106.
Output Format
You must print the following three lines of output:
1.      List is sorted in numSwaps swaps., where numSwaps is the number of swaps that took place.
2.      First Element: firstElement, the  first element in the sorted list.
3.      Last Element: lastElement, the last element in the sorted list.

Sample Input 0
3
1 2 3
Sample Output 0
List is sorted in 0 swaps.
First Element: 1
Last Element: 3

For example:
Input	Result
3
3 2 1	List is sorted in 3 swaps.
First Element: 1
Last Element: 3
5
1 9 2 8 4	List is sorted in 4 swaps.
First Element: 1
Last Element: 9

def bubble_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    swaps = 0
    
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(0, n-i-1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j + 1]:
                # Swap elements
                arr[j], arr[j + 1] = arr[j + 1], arr[j]
                swaps += 1
    
    return swaps

# Input the size of the list
n = int(input())

# Input the list of integers
arr = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Perform bubble sort and count the number of swaps
num_swaps = bubble_sort(arr)

# Print the number of swaps
print("List is sorted in", num_swaps, "swaps.")

# Print the first element
print("First Element:", arr[0])

# Print the last element
print("Last Element:", arr[-1])
