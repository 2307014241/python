Write a program to find the count of non-repeated digits in a given number N. The number will be passed to the program as an input of type int.
Assumption: The input number will be a positive integer number >= 1 and <= 25000.
Some examples are as below.
If the given number is 292, the program should return 1 because there is only 1 non-repeated digit '9' in this number
If the given number is 1015, the program should return 2 because there are 2 non-repeated digits in this number, '0', and '5'.
If the given number is 108, the program should return 3 because there are 3 non-repeated digits in this number, '1', '0', and '8'.
If the given number is 22, the function should return 0 because there are NO non-repeated digits in this number.

For example:
Input	Result
292	  1
1015	2
108  	3
22	  0

n=int(input())
l=[]
k=[]
while n>0:
    a=n%10
    n=n//10
    l.append(a)
for i in range(len(l)):
    if l.count(l[i])==1:
        k.append(l[i])
print(len(k))
