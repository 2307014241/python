Write a program to return the nth number in the fibonacci series. The value of N will be passed to the program as input.

NOTE: Fibonacci series looks like –
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, . . . and so on.
i.e. Fibonacci series starts with 0 and 1, and continues generating the next number as the sum of the previous two numbers.
• first Fibonacci number is 0,
• second Fibonacci number is 1,
• third Fibonacci number is 1,
• fourth Fibonacci number is 2,
• fifth Fibonacci number is 3,
• sixth Fibonacci number is 5,
• seventh Fibonacci number is 8, and so on.

For example:
Input:
7
Output
8

a=[0,1]
for i in range(0,100):
    a.append(a[-1]+a[-2])
q=int(input())
print(a[q-1])
