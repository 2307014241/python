Three numbers form a Pythagorean triple if the sum of squares of two numbers is equal to the square of the third.
For example, 3, 5 and 4 form a Pythagorean triple, since 3*3 + 4*4 = 25 = 5*5 
You are given three integers, a, b, and c. They need not be given in increasing order. If they form a Pythagorean triple, then print "Yes", otherwise, print "No".
