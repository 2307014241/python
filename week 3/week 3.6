Most years have 365 days. However, the time required for the Earth to orbit the Sun is actually slightly more than that. As a result, an extra day, February 29, is included in some years to correct for this difference. Such years are referred to as leap years. The rules for determining whether or not a year is a leap year follow:
• Any year that is divisible by 400 is a leap year.
• Of the remaining years, any year that is divisible by 100 is not a leap year.
• Of the remaining years, any year that is divisible by 4 is a leap year.
• All other years are not leap years.
Write a program that reads a year from the user and displays a message indicating whether or not it is a leap year.
Sample Input 1
1900
Sample Output 1
1900 is not a leap year.
Sample Input 2
2000
Sample Output 2
2000 is a leap year.

year=int(input())
if(year%400==0):
    print(year,"is a leap year.")
else:
    print(year,"is not a leap year.")
