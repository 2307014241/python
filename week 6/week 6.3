Two string values S1, S2 are passed as the input. The program must print first N characters present in S1 which are also present in S2.

Input Format:

The first line contains S1.
The second line contains S2.
The third line contains N.

Output Format:

The first line contains the N characters present in S1 which are also present in S2.

Boundary Conditions:

2 <= N <= 10
2 <= Length of S1, S2 <= 1000

Example Input/Output 1:

Input:

abcbde
cdefghbb
3

Output:

bcd

Note:

b occurs twice in common but must be printed only once.


a=input()
b=input()
C=''
d=int(input())
for i in range(len(a)):
    if(len(C)-d==0):
        break
    else:
        if(a[i]in b):
            if(a[i] not in C):
                C+=a[i]
print (C)
