Given a number with maximum of 100 digits as input, find the difference between the sum of odd and even position digits.
Input Format:
Take a number in the form of String from stdin.
Output Format:
Print the difference between sum of even and odd digits
Example input:
1453
Output:
1
Explanation:
Here, sum of even digits is 4 + 3 = 7
sum of odd digits is 1 + 5 = 6.
Difference is 1.
Note that we are always taking absolute difference
def differenceSum(n):
    a=[]
    b=[]
    k=str(n)
    for i in range(len(k)):
        if int(i)%2==0:
        	a.append(int(k[i]))
        else:
        	b.append(int(k[i]))
    s=sum(b)
    r=sum(a)
    j=s-r
    return j
