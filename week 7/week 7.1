An abundant number is a number for which the sum of its proper divisors is greater than the number itself. Proper divisors of the number are those that are strictly lesser than the number.

Input Format:
Take input an integer from stdin
Output Format:
Return Yes if given number is Abundant. Otherwise, print No
Example input:
12
Output:
Yes
Explanation
The proper divisors of 12 are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, whose sum is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 16. Since sum of proper divisors is greater than the given number, 12 is an abundant number.
Example input:
13
Output:
No
Explanation
The proper divisors of 13 is: 1, whose sum is 1. Since sum of proper divisors is not greater than the given number, 13 is not an abundant number.

For example:
Test				Result
print(abundant(12))		Yes
print(abundant(13))		No
def abundant(n):
    l,s=[],0
    for i in range(1,int(n//2)+1):
        if(n%i==0):
            l.append(i)
    for i in l:
        s+=i
    if(s>n):
        return("Yes")
    else:
        return("No")
