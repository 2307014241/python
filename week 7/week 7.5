complete function to implement coin change making problem i.e. finding the minimum
number of coins of certain denominations that add up to given amount of money.
The only available coins are of values 1, 2, 3, 4
Input Format:
Integer input from stdin.
Output Format:
return the minimum number of coins required to meet the given target.
Example Input:
16
Output:
4
Explanation:
We need only 4 coins of value 4 each
Example Input:
25
Output:
7
Explanation:
We need 6 coins of 4 value, and 1 coin of 1 value

def coinChange(amount):
    # Available coin denominations
    coins = [1, 2, 3, 4]
    # Initialize a list to store the minimum number of coins for each amount from 0 to the target amount
    dp = [float('inf')] * (amount + 1)
    dp[0] = 0  # Base case: 0 coins needed to make amount 0
   
    # Iterate through all amounts from 1 to the target amount
    for i in range(1, amount + 1):
        # Iterate through all available coin denominations
        for coin in coins:
        	# If the current coin denomination is less than or equal to the current amount
        	if coin <= i:
            	# Update dp[i] to be the minimum between its current value and dp[i - coin] + 1
            	dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1)
   
    # The result is stored at dp[amount]
    return dp[amount]
    amount = int(input())
    print(coinChange(amount))
