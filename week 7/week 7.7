A number is considered to be ugly if its only prime factors are 2, 3 or 5.
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, â€¦] is the sequence of ugly numbers.
Task:
complete the function which takes a number n as input and checks if it's an ugly number. return ugly if it is ugly, else return not ugly
Hint:
An ugly number U can be expressed as: U = 2^a * 3^b * 5^c, where a, b and c are nonnegative integers.
For example:
Test	               Result
print(checkUgly(6)) 	ugly 
print(checkUgly(21))	not ugly 

def checkUgly(n):
	for i in range(n):
    	for j in range(n):
        	for k in range(n):
            	if(n==(2**i)+(3**j)+(5**k)):
                	return("ugly")
	return("not ugly")
